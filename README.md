This repository contains some *mathematica* codes I used for homeworks in PH16212: Topics in modern QFT. They are largely based on [Yang Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yzhphy/)'s [5-point momentum twistor](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yzhphy/teaching/code/5pt_twistor_Yang_Teaching.wl) and [Some examples for using Groebner basis](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yzhphy/teaching/code/GB_examples.zip).
